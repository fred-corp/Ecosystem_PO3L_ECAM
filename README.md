Visit the [EcoSym website](https://ecosym.fredcorp.cc) for a live demo !

## Usage

Open folder in a terminal.  
Verify your python version, it sould be 3.9 at least :

```zsh
$ python3 --version
Python 3.9.1
```

Install requirements :

```zsh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Go into the backend directory :

```zsh
cd backend
```

Launch the server:

```zsh
python3 server.py "0.0.0.0"
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000`

> You can also visit the [EcoSym website](https://ecosym.fredcorp.cc) for a live demo !

On the EcoSym website, you can then go to the "simulate" tab, load the example, and then run the simulation.  
More details about the syntax of the example JSON file can be found in the [ecosystemExampleFiles](/ecosystemExampleFiles) folder.

If you run your own instance of the EcoSym simulator, you can change the example JSON (without changing its name) and simply click the "load example" button on the locally hosted website.  
The website may one day have an "upload custom ecosystem file" button, but we didn't have the time to implement that.

## SOLID principles justification

### Single-responsibility principle

> "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."

Each class has it's own responsability. For example a `Plant` object can only act as a plant in the ecosystem. It has it's own methods to get a root zone or a seed zone which are specific to the class responsability.

### Open‚Äìclosed principle

> "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

Let's take the `Animal` class as an example. If we need to create a new animal, we do not need to modify code inside the `Animal` class but just extend it. For example the `get_contact_zone()` method will return a zone based on `contact_zone` which is a parameter defined by the extended class.
