## SOLID principles justification

### Single-responsibility principle

> "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."

Each class has it's own responsability. For example a `Plant` object can only act as a plant in the ecosystem. It has it's own methods to get a root zone or a seed zone which are specific to the class responsability.

### Open‚Äìclosed principle

> "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

Let's take the `Animal` class as an example. If we need to create a new animal, we do not need to modify code inside the `Animal` class but just extend it. For example the `get_contact_zone()` method will return a zone based on `contact_zone` which is a parameter defined by the extended class.
